## Game Nights

Game nights will be all Cosby Cyber members are encouraged to join the Cosby Cyber Discord channel to ask questions about the previous class, discuss other cyber security or game related topics, play video games with a featured game per week as voted on by students.

***Note*** This could be a super bad idea, but also could help to emphasize the difference between in class persona vs. home persona

Could also record the sessions and upload to an unlisted/private Youtube Channel for accountability/awareness and maybe even cool clips/highlights of great gaming sessions.
